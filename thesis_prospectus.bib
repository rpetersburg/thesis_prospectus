abstract = {The EXtreme PREcision Spectrograph (EXPRES) is an optical fiber fed echelle instrument being designed and built at the Yale Exoplanet Laboratory to be installed on the 4.3-meter Discovery Channel Telescope operated by Lowell Observatory. The primary science driver for EXPRES is to detect Earth-like worlds around Sun-like stars. With this in mind, we are designing the spectrograph to have an instrumental precision of 15 cm/s so that the on-sky measurement precision (that includes modeling for RV noise from the star) can reach to better than 30 cm/s. This goal places challenging requirements on every aspect of the instrument development, including optomechanical design, environmental control, image stabilization, wavelength calibration, and data analysis. In this paper we describe our error budget, and instrument optomechanical design.},

abstract = {Modal noise in multimode optical fibers is usually analyzed by using the conventional statistical theory developed for speckle. We show that when little light is lost from the fiber to radiative modes, a constraint of constant total power is introduced that is not present in conventional speckle theory. Experimental results show a marked departure in the behavior of speckle signal-to-noise ratio from the predictions of conventional speckle theory. A suitable modification of this theory is introduced, bringing the theoretical and experimental results into agreement.},

Particular attention is given to the case of supercontinuum generation seeded by femtosecond pulses in the anomalous group velocity dispersion regime of photonic crystal fiber, where the processes of soliton fission, stimulated Raman scattering, and dispersive wave generation are reviewed in detail.

abstract = {We report on bidirectional frequency conversion between the microwave and optical domains using electro-optics. Advances in communications, time keeping, and quantum sensing have all come to depend upon the coherent interoperation of light wave and microwave signals. To connect these domains, which are separated by a factor of 10,000 in frequency, requires specialized technology that has until now only been achieved by ultrafast mode-locked lasers. In contrast, electro-optic modulation (EOM) combs arise deterministically by imposing microwave-rate oscillations on a continuous-wave laser. Here we demonstrate electro-optic generation of a 160 THz bandwidth supercontinuum and realize f-2f self-referencing. Coherence of the supercontinuum is achieved through optical filtering of electronic noise on the seed EOM comb. The mode frequencies of the supercontinuum are derived from the electronic oscillator and they achieve {\textless}5×10−14 fractional accuracy and stability, which opens a novel regime for tunable combs with wide mode spacing apart from the requirements of mode locking.},

@article{Zechmeister2013,
abstract = {Optimal extraction is a key step in processing the raw images of spectra as registered by two-dimensional detector arrays to a one-dimensional format. Previously reported algorithms reconstruct models for a mean one-dimensional spatial profile to assist a properly weighted extraction. We outline a simple optimal extraction algorithm including error propagation, which is very suitable for stabilised, fibre-fed spectrographs and does not model the spatial profile shape. A high signal-to-noise, master-flat image serves as reference image and is directly used as an extraction profile mask. Each extracted spectral value is the scaling factor relative to the cross-section of the unnormalised master-flat which contains all information about the spatial profile as well as pixel-to-pixel variations, fringing, and blaze. The extracted spectrum is measured relative to the flat spectrum. Using echelle spectra of the HARPS spectrograph we demonstrate a competitive extraction performance in terms of signal-to-noise and show that extracted spectra can be used for high precision radial velocity measurement. Pre- or post-flat-fielding of the data is not necessary, since all spectrograph inefficiencies inherent to the extraction mask are automatically accounted for. Also the reconstruction of the mean spatial profile by models is not needed, thereby reducing the number of operations to extract spectra. Flat-relative optimal extraction is a simple, efficient, and robust method that can be applied easily to stabilised, fibre-fed spectrographs.},

@article{Petersburg2018,
abstract = {Optical fiber modal noise is a limiting factor for high precision spectroscopy signal-to-noise in the near-infrared and visible. Unabated, especially when using highly coherent light sources for wavelength calibration, modal noise can induce radial velocity (RV) errors that hinder the discovery of low-mass (and potentially Earth-like) planets. Previous research in this field has found sufficient modal noise mitigation through the use of an integrating sphere, but this requires extremely bright light sources, a luxury not necessarily afforded by the next generation of high-resolution optical spectrographs. Otherwise, mechanical agitation, which "mixes" the fiber's modal patterns and allows the noise to be averaged over minutes-long exposures, provides some noise reduction but the exact mechanism behind improvement in signal-to-noise and RV drift has not been fully explored or optimized by the community. Therefore, we have filled out the parameter space of modal noise agitation techniques in order to better understand agitation's contribution to mitigating modal noise and to discover a better method for agitating fibers. We find that modal noise is best suppressed by the quasi-chaotic motion of two high-amplitude agitators oscillating with varying phase for fibers with large core diameters and low azimuthal symmetry. This work has subsequently influenced the design of a fiber agitator, to be installed with the EXtreme PREcision Spectrograph, that we estimate will reduce modal-noise-induced RV error to less than 3.2 cm/s.},

@article{Magain1998,
abstract = {A new method for improving the resolution of astronomical images is presented. It is based on the principle that sampled data cannot be fully deconvolved without violating the sampling theorem. Thus, the sampled image should be deconvolved not by the total point-spread function but by a narrower function chosen so that the resolution of the deconvolved image is compatible with the adopted sampling. Our deconvolution method gives results that are, in at least some cases, superior to those of other commonly used techniques: in particular, it does not produce ringing around point sources superposed on a smooth background. Moreover, it allows researchers to perform accurate astrometry and photo- metry of crowded Ðelds. These improvements are a consequence of both the correct treatment of sampling and the recognition that the most probable astronomical image is not a {\~{N}}at one. The method is also well adapted to the optimal combination of di†erent images of the same object, as can be obtained, e.g., from infrared observations or via adaptive optics techniques.},

Finally, we demonstrate a method to reduce the spectrum reconstruction error and increase the bandwidth by separately imaging the speckle patterns of orthogonal polarizations.

This noise source can limit the signal-to-noise ratio and jeopardize photon-noise limited data. The subject of the present work is to compare measurements of modal noise and focal-ratio degradation (FRD) for several commonly-used fibres. We study the influence of a simple mechanical scrambling method (excenter) on both FRD and modal noise. Measurements are performed with circular and octagonal fibres from Polymicro Technology (FBP-Series) with diameters of 100, 200 and 300 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m and for square and rectangular fibres from CeramOptec, among others. FRD measurements for the same sample of fibres are performed as a function of wavelength. Furthermore, we replaced the circular fibre of the STELLA-echelle-spectrograph (SES) in Tenerife with an octagonal and found a SNR increase by a factor of 1.6 at 678 nm. It is shown in the laboratory that an excenter with a large amplitude and low frequency will not influence the FRD but will reduce modal noise rather effectively by up to 180{\%}.},

This approach offers advantages over other methods: it produces a broadband, emission comb output from 380-790nm that is difficult to achieve with a laser frequency comb; by injecting into the science fibers before and after observations, weak signals from velocities in the stellar photosphere that would be masked by iodine reference lines can be now be identified; and by locking the laser to an atomic transition, the spectrum will be stabilized to better than 1 part in 10 e-11, corresponding to a wavelength solution that is known to better than 1cm s−1.},

abstract = {The transmission modes of a fiber introduce an unstable intensity distribution in high-resolution spectra which cannot be eliminated by flat-fielding because the pattern is sensitive to any small changes in fiber position or illumination. These instabilities, rather than photon shot noise, limit the achievable signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). In controlled laboratory experiments at a resolution of ∼150,000, we found S/N limited to ≤500 for a range of fiber perturbations and illumination geometries from simple displacement to simulated seeing variations. We find an empirical relation between the number of monochromatic modes and the level of modal noise for which we offer no rigorous explanation. More important, we demonstrate that continuous, low-amplitude agitation of the fiber close to its output completely eliminates the problem. 1.},

abstract = {The Second Workshop on Extreme Precision Radial Velocities defined circa 2015 the state of the art Doppler precision and identified the critical path challenges for reaching 10 cm/s measurement precision. The presentations and discussion of key issues for instrumentation and data analysis and the workshop recommendations for achieving this precision are summarized here. Beginning with the HARPS spectrograph, technological advances for precision radial velocity measurements have focused on building extremely stable instruments. To reach still higher precision, future spectrometers will need to produce even higher fidelity spectra. This should be possible with improved environmental control, greater stability in the illumination of the spectrometer optics, better detectors, more precise wavelength calibration, and broader bandwidth spectra. Key data analysis challenges for the precision radial velocity community include distinguishing center of mass Keplerian motion from photospheric velocities, and the proper treatment of telluric contamination. Success here is coupled to the instrument design, but also requires the implementation of robust statistical and modeling techniques. Center of mass velocities produce Doppler shifts that affect every line identically, while photospheric velocities produce line profile asymmetries with wavelength and temporal dependencies that are different from Keplerian signals. Exoplanets are an important subfield of astronomy and there has been an impressive rate of discovery over the past two decades. Higher precision radial velocity measurements are required to serve as a discovery technique for potentially habitable worlds and to characterize detections from transit missions. The future of exoplanet science has very different trajectories depending on the precision that can ultimately be achieved with Doppler measurements.},

We have collected the first on-sky performance and modal noise tests of these novel fibers in the near-infrared at H and K bands using the CSHELL spectrograph at the NASA InfraRed Telescope Facility (IRTF). We discuss the design behind our novel reverse injection of a red laser for co-alignment of star-light with the fiber tip via a corner cube and visible camera. We summarize the practical details involved in the construction of the fiber scrambler, and the mechanical agitation of the fiber at the telescope. We present radial velocity measurements of a bright standard star taken with and without the fiber scrambler to quantify the relative improvement in the obtainable blaze function stability, the line spread function stability, and the resulting radial velocity precision. We assess the feasibility of applying this illumination stabilization technique to the next generation of near-infrared spectrographs such as iSHELL on IRTF and an upgraded NIRSPEC at Keck. Our results may also be applied in the visible for smaller core diameter fibers where fiber modal noise is a significant factor, such as behind an adaptive optics system or on a small {\textless} 1 meter class telescope such as is being pursued by the MINERVA and LCOGT collaborations},

A solution to this problem - a prototype double scrambler using two fibers coupled by an afocal lens system - is characterized. With the double scrambler, intensity variations across the near- and far-field patterns due to both angular and positional changes in the input beam are reduced by factors ranging from 2 to 10. In all cases, relative variations across the images are reduced to or below the 1-percent level. With the superior image scrambling provided by the double scrambler, pixel shifts of 0.001 can be reliably detected.},

abstract = {Modal noise in optical fibers imposes limits on the signal to noise and velocity precision achievable with the next generation of astronomical spectrographs. This is an increasingly pressing problem for precision radial velocity (RV) spectrographs in the near-infrared (NIR) and optical that require both high stability of the observed line profiles and high signal to noise. Many of these spectrographs plan to use highly coherent emission line calibration sources like laser frequency combs and Fabry-Perot etalons to achieve precision sufficient to detect terrestrial mass planets. These high precision calibration sources often use single mode fibers or highly coherent sources. Coupling light from single mode fibers to multi-mode fibers leads to only a very low number of modes being excited, thereby exacerbating the modal noise measured by the spectrograph. We present a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solution that significantly mitigates modal noise at all optical and NIR wavelengths, and which can be applied to spectrograph calibration systems. Our solution uses an integrating sphere in conjunction with a diffuser that is moved rapidly using electrostrictive polymers, and is generally superior to most tested forms of mechanical fiber agitation. We demonstrate a high level of modal noise reduction with a narrow bandwidth 1550 nm laser. Our relatively inexpensive solution immediately enables spectrographs to take advantage of the innate precision of bright state-of-the art calibration sources by removing a major source of systematic noise.},

A low-finesse Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) can provide a wavelength comb with a very large bandwidth as required for astronomical experiments, but unavoidable spectral drifts are difficult to control. Instead of actively controlling the FPI cavity, we propose to passively stabilize the interferometer and track the time-dependent cavity length drift externally. A dual-finesse cavity allows drift tracking during observation. The drift of the cavity length is monitored in the high-finesse range relative to an external standard: a single narrow transmission peak is locked to an external cavity diode laser and compared to an atomic frequency. Following standard locking schemes, tracking at sub-mm/s precision can be achieved. This is several orders of magnitude better than currently planned high-precision Doppler experiments. It allows freedom for relaxed designs rendering this approach particularly interesting for upcoming Doppler experiments. We also show that the large number of interference modes used in an FPI allows us to unambiguously identify the interference mode of each FPI transmission peak defining its absolute wavelength solution. The accuracy reached in each resonance with the laser concept is then defined by the cavity length that is determined from the one locked peak and by the group velocity dispersion. The latter can vary by several 100m/s over the relevant frequency range and severely limits the accuracy of individual peak locations. A potential way to determine the absolute peak positions is to externally measure the frequency of each individual peak with a laser frequency comb (LFC). Thus, the concept of laser-locked FPIs may be useful for applying the absolute accuracy of an LFC to astronomical spectrographs without the need for an LFC at the observatory.},

abstract = {We have designed a fiber scrambler as a prototype for the Keck HIRES spectrograph, using double scrambling to stabilize illumination of the spectrometer and a slicer to increase spectral resolution to R ∼ 70; 000 with minimal slit losses.We find that the spectral line-spread function (SLSF) for the double scrambler observations is 18 times more stable than the SLSF for comparable slit observations and 9 times more stable than the SLSF for a single fiber scrambler that we tested in 2010. For the double scrambler test data, we further reduced the radial velocity scatter from an average of ∼2:1 ms?1 to ∼1:5 ms?1 after adopting a median description of the stabilized SLSF in our Doppler model. This demonstrates that inaccuracies in modeling the SLSF contribute to the velocity rms. Imperfect knowledge of the SLSF, rather than stellar jitter, sets the precision floor for chromospherically quiet stars analyzed with the iodine technique using Keck HIRES and other slit-fed spectrometers. It is increasingly common practice for astronomers to scale stellar noise in quadrature with formal errors such that their Keplerian model yields a $\chi$2 fit of 1.0. When this is done, errors from inaccurate modeling of the SLSF (and perhaps from other sources) are attributed to the star, and the floor of the stellar noise is overestimated.},

abstract = {Context. Searching for extrasolar planets through radial velocity measurements relies on the stability of stellar photospheres. Several phenomena are known to affect line profiles in solar-type stars, among which stellar oscillations, granulation and magnetic activity through spots, plages and activity cycles. Aims. We aim at characterizing the statistical properties of magnetic activity cycles, and studying their impact on spectroscopic measurements such as radial velocities, line bisectors and line shapes. Methods. We use data from the HARPS high-precision planet-search sample comprising 304 FGK stars followed over about 7 years. We obtain high-precision Ca II H{\&}K chromospheric activity measurements and convert them to R′ HK indices using an updated calibration taking into account stellar metallicity. We study R′ HK variability as a function of time and search for possible correlations with radial velocities and line shape parameters. Results. The obtained long-term precision of∼0.35{\%} on S-index measurements is about 3 times better than the canonical Mt Wilson survey, which opens new possibilities to characterize stellar activity. We classify stars according to the magnitude and timescale of the Ca II H{\&}K variability, and identify activity cycles whenever possible. We find that 39±8{\%} of old solar-type stars in the solar neighborhood do not show any activity cycles (or only very weak ones), while 61±8{\%} do have one. Non-cycling stars are almost only found among G dwarfs and at mean activity levels log R′ HK {\textless} -4.95. Magnetic cycle amplitude generally decreases with decreasing activity level. A significant fraction of stars exhibit small variations in radial velocities and line shape parameters that are correlated with activity cycles. The sensitivity of radial velocities to magnetic cycles increases towards hotter stars, while late K dwarfs are almost insensitive. Conclusions. Activity cycles do induce long-period, low-amplitude radial velocity variations, at levels up to ∼25 ms−1. Caution is therefore mandatory when searching for long-period exoplanets. However, these effects can be corrected to high precision by detrending the radial velocity data using simultaneous measurements ofCa II H{\&}K flux and line shape parameters.},

abstract = {We describe a new algorithm for the "perfect" extraction of one-dimensional spectra from two-dimensional (2D) digital images of optical fiber spectrographs, based on accurate 2D forward modeling of the raw pixel data. The algorithm is correct for arbitrarily complicated 2D point-spread functions (PSFs), as compared to the traditional optimal extraction algorithm, which is only correct for a limited class of separable PSFs. The algorithm results in statistically independent extracted samples in the 1D spectrum, and preserves the full native resolution of the 2D spectrograph without degradation. Both the statistical errors and the 1D resolution of the extracted spectrum are accurately determined, allowing a correct chi-squared comparison of any model spectrum with the data. Using a model PSF similar to that found in the red channel of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectrograph, we compare the performance of our algorithm to that of cross-section based optimal extraction, and also demonstrate that our method allows coaddition and foreground estimation to be carried out as an integral part of the extraction step. This work demonstrates the feasibility of current- and next-generation multi-fiber spectrographs for faint galaxy surveys even in the presence of strong night-sky foregrounds. We describe the handling of subtleties arising from fiber-to-fiber crosstalk, discuss some of the likely challenges in deploying our method to the analysis of a full-scale survey, and note that our algorithm could be generalized into an optimal method for the rectification and combination of astronomical imaging data.},

abstract = {We present time series measurements of chromospheric activity for more than 2600 main-sequence and subgiant stars on the California Planet Search (CPS) program with spectral types ranging from about F5V to M4V for main-sequence stars and from G0IV to about K5IV for subgiants. The large data set of more than 44,000 spectra allows us to identify an empirical baseline floor for chromospheric activity as a function of color and height above the main sequence. We define $\Delta$S as an excess in emission in the Ca ii H and K lines above the baseline activity floor and define radial velocity jitter as a function of $\Delta$S and B−V for main-sequence and subgiant stars. Although the jitter for any individual star can always exceed the baseline level, we find that K dwarfs have the lowest level of jitter. The lack of correlation between observed jitter and chromospheric activity in K dwarfs suggests that the observed jitter is dominated by instrumental or analysis errors and not astrophysical noise sources. Thus, given the long-term precision for the CPS program, radial velocities are not correlated with astrophysical noise for chromospherically quiet K dwarf stars, making these stars particularly well suited for the highest precision Doppler surveys. Chromospherically quiet F and G dwarfs and subgiants exhibit higher baseline levels of astrophysical jitter than K dwarfs. Despite the fact that the rms in Doppler velocities is correlated with the mean chromospheric activity, it is rare to see one-to-one correlations between the individual time series activity and Doppler measurements, diminishing the prospects for correcting activity-induced velocity variations in F and G dwarfs.},

Upgrades to the instrument improved the Doppler precision from about 10 m s−1 in 1992 to about 3 m s−1 in 1995. The project detected dozens of exoplanets with orbital periods ranging from a few days to several years. The Lick survey identified the first planet in an eccentric orbit (70 Virginis) and the first multi-planet system around a normal main sequence star (Upsilon Andromedae). These discoveries advanced our understanding of planet formation and orbital migration. Data from this project helped to quantify a correlation between host star metallicity and the occurrence rate of gas giant planets. The program also served as a test bed for innovation with testing of a tip-tilt system at the Coud´e focus and fiber scrambler designs to stabilize illumination of the spectrometer optics.

This device consists of a single optic: a high-index {\$}n{\$}{\$}\backslashsim{\$}2 ball lens that exchanges the near and far fields between two fibers. When used in conjunction with octagonal fibers, this device yields very high scrambling gains and greatly desensitizes the fiber output from any input illumination variations, thereby stabilizing the instrument profile of the spectrograph and improving the Doppler measurement precision. The system is also highly insensitive to input pupil variations, isolating the spectrograph from telescope illumination variations and seeing changes. By selecting the appropriate glass and lens diameter the highest efficiency is achieved when the fibers are practically in contact with the lens surface, greatly simplifying the alignment process when compared to classical double-scrambler systems. This prototype double-scrambler has demonstrated significant performance gains over previous systems, achieving scrambling gains in excess of 10,000 with a throughput of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}87{\%} using uncoated Polymicro octagonal fibers. Adding a circular fiber to the fiber train further increases the scrambling gain to {\$}{\textgreater}{\$}20,000, limited by laboratory measurement error. While this fiber system is designed for the Habitable-zone Planet Finder spectrograph, it is more generally applicable to other instruments in the visible and near-infrared.

However, silicon is limited to wavelengths above 1100 nm and does not allow device operation in the visible spectrum range where low noise lasers are conveniently available. The narrow band gap of silicon also makes silicon optomechanical devices susceptible to strong two-photon absorption and free carrier absorption, which often introduce strong thermal effect that limit the devices' stability and cooling performance. Further, silicon also does not provide the desired lowest order optical nonlinearity for interfacing with other active electrical components on a chip. On the other hand, aluminum nitride (AlN) is a wideband semiconductor widely used in micromechanical resonators due to its low mechanical loss and high electromechanical coupling strength. Here we report the development of AlN-on-silicon platform for low loss, wideband optical guiding, as well as its use for achieving simultaneous high optical quality and mechanical quality optomechanical devices. Exploiting AlN's inherent second order nonlinearity we further demonstrate electro-optic modulation and efficient second-harmonic generation in AlN photonic circuits.

@article{Sturmer2017,
abstract = {We report on the construction and testing of a vacuum-gap Fabry–P{\'{e}}rot etalon calibrator for high precision radial velocity spectrographs. Our etalon is traced against a rubidium frequency standard to provide a cost effective, yet ultra precise wavelength reference. We describe here a turn-key system working at 500 to 900 nm, ready to be installed at any current and next-generation radial velocity spectrograph that requires cal- ibration over a wide spectral bandpass. Where appropriate, we have used off-the-shelf, commercial components with demonstrated long-term performance to accelerate the development timescale of this instrument. Our system combines for the first time the advantages of passively stabilized etalons for optical and near-infrared wavelengths with the laser-locking technique demonstrated for single-mode fiber etalons. We realize uncertainties in the position of one etalon line at the 10 cms−1 level in individual measurements taken at 4 Hz. When binning the data over 10 s, we are able to trace the etalon line with a precision of better than 3 cms−1. We present data obtained during a week of continuous operation where we detect (and correct for) the predicted, but previously unobserved shrinking of the etalon Zerodur spacer corresponding to a shift of 13 cms−1 per day.},
